# Breast Cancer Detection Model
A Breast Cancer Detection Model using Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a machine learning algorithm designed to identify and classify breast tumors as either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) based on features extracted from breast cancer biopsy samples. SVM, a powerful classification technique, works by finding the optimal decision boundary that best separates the two classes in a high-dimensional feature space.
