# Gradient Descent

Gradient Descent is a widely used optimization algorithm in machine learning and numerical optimization. It's used to minimize a function by adjusting its parameters iteratively. Gradient Descent is particularly essential in training machine learning models to find the best set of parameters that minimize a cost or loss function.
