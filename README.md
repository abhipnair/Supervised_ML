# Supervised_ML 
Supervised machine learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm learns from labeled training data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. In here, I am displaying my exercises which i get from resources on the internet. Have fun in using it yourself optimising the code. Happy Learing."
