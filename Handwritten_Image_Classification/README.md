# Hand Written Image Classification.

In this project we are writing a model which can recoginise handwritten digits. An 8x8 image is feed into the ml algorithm which uses certain type of mathamtical and statistical method to convert the image into certain type of classes they fall so this is a type of Multi class Logistic Regression model.

## Features

- Easy to use.
- Can recoginise handwritten digits just by loading the model provided in the code.
- You can predict things upto an accuracy of 97%


## Importing Model


To load the model and use this lines of code in a Python Script :

```python
  # To load the model we can use joblib.
    import joblib
    model = joblib.load("HandWritten_Number_Prediction_Model")
    model.predict(Testing_Data) 
```


To use model generated by svm
```python
  # To load the model we can use joblib.
    import joblib
    model = joblib.load("Hand_Written_Digits_Classification_Model")
    model.predict(Testing_Data) 
```
