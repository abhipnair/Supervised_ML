# Titanic Ship Accident Survival Prediction Model. 

In this project, I am writing a alogrithm for a ml model to predict the survival of pepole from the titanic ship sink accident. In this the details of people is fed into a decison tree algorithm after some data preprocessing.

## Features

- Easy to use.
- You can predict will you would survive the disaster giving your data to the ml model. 
- You can predict things upto an accuracy of 82.8%. 


## Importing Model


To load the model and use this line of code in a Python Script :

```python
  # To load the model we can use joblib.
    import joblib
    model = joblib.load("Titanic_Survival_Prediction_Model")
    model.predict(Testing_Data)  # to know how to predict just go through the code
    # for prediction array_must contain [['sepal length (cm)', 'sepal width (cm)', 'petal length (cm)', 'petal width (cm)']]
    # use double square brackets eg: model.predict([[5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2]])
```
